# Enabling IPV6 on Primary Network Interface

This tools don't touch your primary network interface.
If you've enabled IPv6 on this interface and want to have IPv6 assigned
to it by DHCP, you should configure manually your cloud-init by adding
this configuration lines:

    network:
      version: 2
      ethernets:
        # Use eth0 or ens3 depending on Predictable Network Interface Names
        ens3:
          dhcp4: true
          dhcp6: true
          
This configuration may be added either on your [instance user data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html#user-data-cloud-init) or inside the `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/`.
